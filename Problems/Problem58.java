 * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square

 * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
 * diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
 * along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 * 
 * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
 * with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the
 * side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
 * diagonals first falls below 10%?
